# A Keras-Like Deep Neural Network Abstraction

An OOP Deep Neural Network using a similar syntax as Keras with many hyper-parameters, optimizers and activation functions available.

## Installation

Just clone the repository to your computer to get started:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:kinoute/keras-like-nn-ezel.git
cd keras-like-nn-ezel
```

The only dependency to make this neural network work is "numpy". It can be installed directly from the main directory if you don't have it already:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
